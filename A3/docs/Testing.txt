-Item gets written to a file and the floor shows after the player moves
-Able to read item and show what they picked up, stores into a file and replaces file tile

INVENTORY:
-After items picked up, store to file to print at end of game
-Mvinch reads it and makes it go into file
-Mvinch reads it, not storing to the file or to function

PRINTING ROOMS:
-Print everything from parsed strings accordingly to where the coordinates are 
-Printing flawless for the walls and tiles
-Had to add a '-' to the walls to make it even, other than that works great

PRINTING DOORS:
-Print in corresponding spot
-Show in the wall and over write the '-' or '|'
-Prints correctly, no issues
