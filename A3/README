Running the program(s)

Type in bin/run "assets/filename.txt" to compile the program.
If you do not enter anything for the filename then the program will exit. You must put the directory and file.

The program will open to the ncurses window and show the room.


You use w,a,s,d to move your player

They are able to pick up items and not move through walls.
For this one, you can move anywhere around the terminal.
It will replace picked up characters and with the floor tiles

*****************
Known Limitations
*****************
Alright, prepare for disaster:

Does not print out 6 rooms
Can only print the first line - do not put other lines unless you hate me
Doesn't replace doors
Doesn't show inventory
Doesn't print last item in the file
Can't warp to different rooms because well, there is only one room
xPosition for the items stay constant from the first item found
It works on the pi sometimes, other times the walls won't draw
it does compile on my laptop
